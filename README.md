A simple Portfolio to reach out to customers/clients in need of my service.

The original PSD is included and was provided by [Sergey Melnik](https://www.behance.net/SergeyMelnik).

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
